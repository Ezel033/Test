            <h3>Q: What is a Guild?</h3>
            <p>Guild is a group of players who decided to play together indefinitely. Guilds have a name, slogan and managed by the Guild Leader.</p>
            <p>Guilds can level up, granting members privileges, such as gold and experience. In addition, you will receive daily rewards.<h3>The guild rewards can only be claimed by the Guild Leader and Officer, the rest of the members automatically receive rewards once claimed.</h3></p>
            <p>At each level, the limit of guild members will also increase. A guild can go up to level 4.</p>

                <li> How to join or create a Guild?

Tap on the Guilds icon on the right side of the screen.</li>
                <li>You can search for some specific guild you would like to join or pick an available guild from the list. The list can be refreshed every 30 seconds. To be able to join the guild you need to meet the guild requirements: have a specific ingame level/rank or be approved by the Guild Leader.</li>
                <p>Tap on the Create Guild button and create your own Guild. Fill in Guild information (Name, Slogan) and set up Guild requirements (Approval Method, Player Level, Player Rank). At last, you need to spend 1000 Diamonds or 5000 Gold to create a Guild.</p>

            <h3>Q: What is Glory and how it works?</h3>
            <ul>
                <p>Glory is required for the Guild to level up. By joining a Guild, you will earn Glory at the end of each game. The more Guild members are playing, the more Glory it will earn and the faster it will level up. </p>
